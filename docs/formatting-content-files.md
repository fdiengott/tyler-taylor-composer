# Formatting Content Files

This is a quick guide to markdown, the language used throughout this project so that anyone with permission can easily update the text and add new content. Markdown files end with the extension `.md`.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. There are only a few rules to learn, so it is very easy to pick up and use.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of Markdown is as follows:

```
One can type in some simple text like this and it will be rendered as a paragraph. Just space separate lines in markdown to create a new paragraph.

**Bold text**
_Italic text_
`Code text`

### Custom notes

On the individual works details pages, note that I have made it so that if you do a numbered list (e.g. 1. 2. etc.), then it will render on the screen with roman numerals. If it shouldn't be that way I'll have to go in and change it.
