Tyler Taylor (1992) is a composer-performer and teaching artist from Louisville, KY. Much of his work is dedicated to creating abstract musical analogies for social-political happenings both present and past. Common among these pieces is a sense of contradiction – sometimes whimsical, sometimes alarming – that comes from the interaction of diverse musical layers.

Tyler was recently a full time resident composer at the Louisville Orchestra as part of the inaugural installation of their Creators Corps residency program. In this role Tyler wrote several new works for the orchestra and worked closely with organizations, schools, and programs in the city of Louisville. He established and taught the Louisville Orchestra Young Composer Program for JCPS students grades 4-12 where students had new compositions workshopped and performed by members of the LO. Most recently he was named the winner of the 2024 San Francisco Emerging Black Composer Project commission award. Tyler has also held residencies at the I-Park Foundation (2023) and the Copland House (2023).

He has been commissioned by Jon P. Cherry, the Louisville Orchestra, Washington and Lee State University, the Youth Performing Arts School, the Chicago Composers Orchestra, the Indiana University New Music Ensemble, the Indiana Band Masters Association, the National Orchestral Institute, and more.

His work has been recognized by awards including the New Music USA Creator Fund, the BMI Student Composer Award (2019) and the Howard Hanson Ensemble Prize (2017, 2016). He also held fellowships at the Bowdoin International Music Festival (2021) and the National Orchestral Institute (2021).

In addition to his pursuits in composition, Tyler also performs the horn in various settings ranging from recitals of contemporary music to professional orchestral settings. These include the Columbus Indiana Philharmonic, Huntington Symphony, Louisville Ballet, and the Owensboro Symphony. He maintains a studio of young horn players in Louisville and southern Indiana.

Tyler holds degrees from Indiana University (Doctor of Music with minors in Music Theory & Horn Performance), the Eastman School of Music (Master of Music), and the University of Louisville (Bachelor of Music).
