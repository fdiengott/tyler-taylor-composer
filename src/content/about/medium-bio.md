Tyler Taylor (1992) is a composer-performer and teaching artist from Louisville, KY. Much of his work is dedicated to creating abstract musical analogies for social-political happenings both present and past. Common among these pieces is a sense of contradiction – sometimes whimsical, sometimes alarming – that comes from the interaction of diverse musical layers.
He has received commissions from the San Francisco Symphony, Jon P. Cherry, the Louisville Orchestra, Washington and Lee University, the Youth Performing Arts School, the Chicago Composers Orchestra, the Indiana University New Music Ensemble, the Indiana Bandmasters Association, the National Orchestral Institute, and others. His work has been recognized with awards such as the New Music USA Creator Fund (2024), the BMI Student Composer Award (2019), and the Howard Hanson Ensemble Prize (2017, 2016). He has also held fellowships at the Bowdoin International Music Festival (2021) and the National Orchestral Institute (2021).

Tyler holds degrees from Indiana University (Doctor of Music, with minors in Music Theory and Horn Performance), the Eastman School of Music (Master of Music), and the University of Louisville (Bachelor of Music).
