## Program Notes:

Anesthetic Dreams was commissioned by Jackie Royce for the occasion of an annual fundraising concert for the Louisville Girls Club that culminates in a communal performance of Terry Riley’s In C.

This piece explores three dreamscapes – an aura of harmonic glissandi; melting, sighing gures; and a meditation on a quote from Stravinsky’s Symphony in Three Movements. The piece ends with a jolting awakening and half-remembrances of the dreams that came before.

The voice part is for a male voice with access to extended falsetto. There is no text.
