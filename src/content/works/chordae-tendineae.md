## Program Notes:

As a horn player, I have always been struck by a simple commonality between the trombone and my instrument – a tenor trombone with an F extension is essentially the same as a double horn (resting in F with a Bb side). Composers of the 20th and 21st centuries often take advantage of the horn’s easy access to the uppermost partials of the overtones series – this was something I too wanted to explore, but with trombones. The slide glissando, while sometimes associated with humor, is for me something that evokes a melancholic sigh and is charged with emotive energy. This, in combination with the nature-oriented and even sometimes otherworldly sound of the natural overtones series, creates the world this pieces exists within.

Chordae tendineae refers to anatomical structures that provide essential structural integrity and proper function within the chambers of the heart. These are also known as heartstrings. The idea of small and seemingly delicate bers holding together and supporting the organ that sustains life in such a basic and profound way resonates with the expressive qualities of this music.
