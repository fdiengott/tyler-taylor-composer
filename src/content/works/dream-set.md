## Program Notes:

This piece was composed quickly during the summer of 2021 while in residency at the Bowdoin International Music Festival. I had the pleasure of meeting several extremely talented pianists including Chris Soong, Stephen Joven-Lee, Anthony Ratinov, and Angie Zhang. These four were particularly supportive of the idea of me writing a set of miniatures that would involve them as soloists. The result was these four movements that capture brief moments of daydream-like whimsey.
