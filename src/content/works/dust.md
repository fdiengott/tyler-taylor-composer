## Program Notes:

This piece was created for the 2021 Bowdoin International Music Festival. It is an extraction and arrangement of the middle movement from a larger work called Modus operandi for a mixed octet of winds, strings, percussion, and piano.

This movement, titled Dust, refers to the idea of something mundane, muted, and melancholic in nature. The title also suggests that the music is the lighter remnant or even residue of something that came before, or that has settled in place in the aftermath of its passing.
