## Program Notes:

The first movement "Consequence" operates on two related ideas. One is the idea of an object resisting movement that is set into motion, gaining momentum as it tumbles towards its eventual resting place. The other is the idea that an object can endure trivial damage; however, if this damage is sustained, regardless of how trivial, the object will eventually become compromised.

The second movement "In the wake" is a reinterpretation of and reaction to "Consequence." It is concerned with the aftermath of the action that has taken place before it. The title "Encompass" serves to contextualize the proportion of the events which inspired this music.

## Movements:

1. Consequence
2. In the Wake
