## Program Notes:

_Green Light_ is a celebratory dance capturing the emotions of energized excitement, occasional frustration, and the ultimate gratification of a transitional time of my life. The interpretations of the title, whether they be that of a literal green traffic light or a more figurative aura of green light, are both significant to the work. The strongest connection to the idea of a "green light" would be the inherent message, "to go."At the age of eighteen, preparing for my first year of college, I was ready "to go." _Green Light_ was the result.

The piece is based on three themes. The first is the eight note motive which begins the piece. This motive comes back augmented, fragmented, in different voices, or with other alterations several times during the piece. The second theme is the syncopated dance rhythm found in the saxophones in measures 3-6. Almost all of the melodic statements occur within this rhythmic pattern. Lastly, the third theme is the melodic notion introduced by the woodwinds in measures 16-19. Building up to the last climax of this piece, (measures 97-103), all of the themes are juxtaposed to create this last moment of busy anticipation.
