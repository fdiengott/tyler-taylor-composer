## Program Notes:

It is known that scent is the sense that has the strongest connection to memory. This piece was written for my friend Ryan Snapp who I met at the Sewanee Summer Music Festival in 201 2. The neo-gothic campus and surrounding woods are full of juniper bushes and tress - the scent hung heavy in the hot summer air. The scent of juniper will always remind me of that summer and the beginning of our friendship.
