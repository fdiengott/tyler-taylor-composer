## Program Notes:

_Les Poulets_, or The Chickens, is a rhythmically driven, mostly cheery piece that utilizes an unusual combination of accessory wind instruments.While a vast majority of people seem to continue the slightly negative reputations of these instruments, I find them particularly appealing. I wished to write music that would use them in a pleasing and enjoyable manner.The result was Les Poulets.The French title is a nod to composers such as Ravel, who used the Eb clarinet and piccolo extensively, and Ibert, who wrote orchestral and solo literature for the saxophone.
