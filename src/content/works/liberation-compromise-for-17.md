## Program Notes:

“Liberation Compromise” is cast in three attacca movements. The first is the presentation of the four ensembles, each demonstrating a distinct character and identity based upon the characteristic qualities of the instruments that comprise them. The entries of the ensembles accumulate creating a mass of sound in which the individual ensembles can no longer be distinguished. The second movement begins with this sound mass and the unraveling of the strict boundaries of the original ensembles. What follows is a sequence of solos, trios, and chamber settings as new pairings emerge. The character of the new pairings is also determined by the qualities of the instruments which are being featured. As this section comes to a close, the accumulation process analogous to that in the first movement denotes the reformation of the original ensembles, this time with an imposed constriction of the range of the tutti ensemble moving toward a unison E5. The statement of the unison E marks the beginning of the third movement. Here, the original ensembles are void of their distinct identities making only statements which are uniform in gesture and character, always at the unison within each of the ensembles.

This piece is an _exploration_ of issues concerning identity that I find to be particularly relevant not only to myself, but to our society as a whole. However, it does not pretend to put forth any specific idea or symbol for resolution or reconciliation of these issues. I offer “Liberation Compromise” simply as a musical manifestation of my own struggle with these ideas.
