## Program Notes:

The title “Manifest” takes advantage of this word’s several meanings:

- something that is clear or obvious or the action of making something clear or obvious
- a list or inventory
- colloquially, to will something into being

The first two meanings capture the essence of the architecture of the piece. It is made entirely from three simple units:

- a repeating rhythm that alternates groups of 5 and 3 that begin with longer notes and end with a short one
- a florid, scurrying sixteenth note figure
- a long, lyric line

The piece follows a traditional form that explores the different combinations of these three units. Each time a new pairing is explored, the materials are developed and stretched in new ways.

The last meaning captures the expressive quality and spirit of the music. It is at times playful, assertive, euphoric, and ecstatic and at other times mysterious, apprehensive, and foreboding. The bombastic, dance-like music of this piece is unusual for me, and triumphs over everything.

With special thanks to Chris Dobbins, Washington and Lee University, and Kimcherie Lloyd.
