## Program Notes:

This piece was commissioned by the Youth Performing Arts School to commemorate the retirement of Curtis Essig who taught at the school from 1993 to 2021. I was fortunate enough to be a student at YPAS from 2008 - 2011. Some of the most important and defining moments of my musical development occurred under Mr. Essig’s guidance including my first premiere – a piece I wrote for the YPAS Wind Ensemble in 2011 called “Green Light”. Mr. Essig conducted while Kevin Callihan, who was student teaching at the time, and I performed in the ensemble.

“Memento No. 2” is presented in two parts – one that is slower, contemplative, and somber in mood and the other more celebratory and triumphant. The first half reflects on times passed and reverently solutes the end of Mr. Essig’s time at YPAS. The second half excitedly celebrates his legacy and his passing of the baton to Mr. Callihan who will carry on a program that has and will continue to shape the lives of a significant number of musicians.

When I started this piece I knew I wanted to incorporate a type of musical cryptogram that would represent Mr. Essig. In this case I used the major chords C, E, and G to broadly represent his name. These chords act both as thematic and harmonic pillars throughout the piece. Additionally, the opening trumpet solos and subsequent fanfares pay tribute to Mr. Essig’s trumpet playing. The piece subtly nods to a number of composers Mr. Essig and I admire – the architecture of the piece is framed by several extended quotes from one of these composer’s symphonies.
