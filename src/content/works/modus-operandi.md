## Program Note:

_Modus operandi_ is a piece whose procedures and musical materials are inspired by many of
my earlier works. This conscious revisiting and recontextualization of earlier ideas is the main
reason for the title.

_Resounding_ plays on both the denition meaning emphatic but also literally to sound again.

_Dust_ aims to capture both the idea of something mundane - muted and melancholic in mood -
and also the idea of a much lighter remnant or residue left over from something else.

_Broader than the original_ is a rough translation of the marking _"noch briefer all su Anfang"_ from the Adagio of Mahler’s Symphony No. 9. It occurs when the tutti horns play an elaboration of the
main melody – a moment which has resonated with me for quite some time. I do not intend the
horn line to be recognized – it is there only as a point of reference. In this context, the weaving of this line into my musical fabric is taken to its highest level adding yet another layer of meaning to the title.
