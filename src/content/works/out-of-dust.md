## Program Notes:

"Out of Dust" is an exploration of how memories can transform as they cycle back and forth between the conscious and subconscious mind. Oftentimes, I find myself struggling to decipher whether the feeling of a memory is the authentic original, or if it is a version influenced by my current state of mind. I like to think that the music of this piece undergoes similar transformations – maintaining integral aspects while the surrounding context is greatly altered. Is it familiar at this point, something new, or perhaps a sense of déjà vu?
