## Program Notes:

I've found the association of color with different moods of music to be quite strong - not only for myself, but for others as well. Through these three movements, I have assigned titles that very generally reflect the color sensations they may evoke. Aside from ideas of color, this piece explores a variety of emotions and characters ranging from youthful whim, elation, wit, and humor to despair and woe. The wind quintet, with five unique and distinct instruments, offers a myriad of colors and timbres making it the perfect medium for this idea.
