## Program Notes:

“Recollections” is a piece inspired by vocal styles and ornaments found in popular music from the late 90’s and early 2000’s. I was particularly interested in capturing the indulgent, nimble, and at times flashy qualities of the melismatic runs that are characteristic of these songs. Another point of inspiration from this collection of work is the performers’ free approach to rhythm, as they push and pull against the framework of time to deliver emotionally charged and expressive lines. The saxophone’s lyric, vocal qualities paired with its nimble facility made it the perfect instrument for this exploration.

Essentially all of the music I listened to growing up was popular radio music. While many of these songs and artists left a lasting impression on me, I had no idea who they were or what the songs were called. Recently, I have been revisiting these songs and artists in what has become a nostalgic rediscovery of the music of my childhood. This dreamy, hazy sense of nostalgia sets the tone of “Recollections,” as I recontextualize elements of this music within my own language.
