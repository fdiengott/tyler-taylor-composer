## Program Notes:

_"some notes"_ is a horn quartet in three movements inspired by Charles Bukowski's poems _some notes on Bach and Haydn, Mahler, Bruckner,_ and _Beethoven conducted his last symphony while totally deaf_. The movements of my piece do not neatly
correspond to one single poem but take inspiration from several at once. The piece as a whole explores themes and
images I found common among the set, most notably a sense of melancholy and contradiction. I chose the title _"some
notes"_ because I think of my piece as being like "some notes" on Bukowski's poetry the way his poems are "some notes" on the composers and ideas which inspired him.

_Prelude_ contains all the seeds of musical material that are developed in the subsequent movements. This movement also
serves as a (very shy) nod to Bach including his musical cryptogram.

_"...as you are..."_ is from a line in the poem _Mahler_. This movement deals with my own deep connection with Mahler's
music as well as my personal reaction to this poem. The element of contradiction plays out in this movement by way
of two contrasting musical ideas that are set against each other in various ways. The most explicit musical quotations
occur in this movement from symphonies 5 and 9.

_"...I missed..."_ is from a line in the poem _Bruckner_. This movement, perhaps the most melancholic in mood and
character, tries to convey the idea of "missing" by setting up cadential patterns that never quite align. The trajectory of
the movement is also loosely inspired by the last movement of Mahler's ninth symphony and his sequence of prayers. Each one gains in intensity and passion with the hope of being answered until the last which seems to surrender to the
realization that it will not be fulfilled.

The lines that resonated with me the most and acted as a guide for the entire piece are from _Beethoven conducted his last
symphony while totally deaf_. They are as follows:

> that man should be as durable as his
>
> art, that's what they want, they want the
>
> impossible: creation and creator to be as
>
> one. this is the dirty trick
>
> of the ages.
