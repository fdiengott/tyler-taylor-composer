## Program Notes:

“Uncharted” depicts the exploration of an unknown and mysterious place. The explorer feels excited but also hesitant as they forge further into this unfamiliar environment. After summoning the courage to face the fear of the unknown, they happen upon something grand, beautiful, but also bizarre – something they’ve never seen before! The explorer leaves only to find that the mysterious place is now suddenly familiar and totally ordinary. Inspired by their discovery, now only a memory, they set off with renewed confidence to explore more new places.
