## Program Notes:

VIE No 2 is a piece that explores the technical capabilities of the horn in ways that both embrace and challenge the prevailing notions of what the horn is. In doing so, the performer is asked to perform in ways that may seem alien, either because it is a kind of music not usually explored by the horn or is one that takes advantage of the natural tendencies of the horn they are taught to fight against. These kinds of music making include florid gestures in the lowest register of the horn, usage of “out of tune” fingerings, usage of “out of tune” partials of the natural horn, and exaggerated inflection by the right hand. The scenario of this piece depicts a process of futile avoidance, reflection, obsession, and bewilderment. This piece is preceded by the original VIE for solo horn which also deals with the technical capabilities of the horn.
