## Program Notes:

“Vie” is a piece that is presented in seven sections that alternate between fanfare type declamations and more lyric reflections. The seven parts explore portions of the opening declamation and expand on the mood and character it evokes.

The title “Vie” is an indicator of the contrasting relationship between the declamations and reflections – the declamations are more dominant and imposing while the reflections assert themselves in more subtle ways. I also offer “Vie” as a symbol of my attitude toward the horn and its technical capabilities as compared to other instruments.
